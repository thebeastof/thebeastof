### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**thebeastof/thebeastof** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on python and html/css.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning python and html/css.
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on a project with my friends.
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with nothing until further notice.
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about nothing because I am not experienced in software engineering.
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: Don't.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I tried the Khan Academy Software engineering course. Don't do it. It is better if you use Code HS
