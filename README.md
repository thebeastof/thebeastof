### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**thebeastof/thebeastof is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started: -->

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on python and _html/css_.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning python and html/css.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on a project with my __friends__.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with nothing <int>until further notice</int>.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about nothing because I am not experienced in software engineering.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Don't.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I tried the Khan Academy Software engineering course. Don't do it. It is better if you use Code HS
