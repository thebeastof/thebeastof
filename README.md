### Hi there 👋

<!--
**thebeastof/thebeastof is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started: -->

- 🔭 I’m currently working on python and _html/css_.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python and html/css.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on a project with my __friends__.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with nothing <int>until further notice</int>.
- 💬 Ask me about nothing because I am not experienced in software engineering.
- 📫 How to reach me: Don't.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I tried the Khan Academy Software engineering course. Don't do it. It is better if you use Jet Brains
